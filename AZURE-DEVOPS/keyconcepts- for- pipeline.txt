keyconcepts of azure pipeline

agent:

 when you build or deployment runs, the system begins one or more jobs.
 An agent is installable software that runs one job at a time
 
 To build your code or deploy your software using azure pipelines,
 you need at least one agent
 
 azure devops we can use 2 types of agent
 microsoft-hosted agent
 self-hosted agent
 
 approvals:
 
 are a set of validations which are required before a deployment can be performed
 
 ex: getting permission from the someone in a team 
 before the deployment on production
 
 
 Artifacts
 
 is a collection of files or packages which are created by a build runs
 these artifacts are then made available for the next task: i.c deployment
 
 
 app----artifact---deployment
 
 
 Environment
 
is the place where we deploy our application
is a collection of resources
ex: vms container ,webapp etc

A release pipleine can deply the code on one or more VMs(Environments)
aftert build pipleing is completed

Job

a job represents an exeution boundary of set of steps
all of the steps run together on the same agent
ex: you might build two configurations- x86 and x64.
in this case, you have one build stage and two jobs


Run

one execution of a pipleine(build or release) is known as run

Stage

is used to mark serpartion of concerns
ex: create a build for qa, staging, production etc
each stage contains one or more jobs
stage is very important in adding an extra level
of validation before your code goes to production

Triger

is a setup that tells the pipeline when to run
we can configure a pipeline when-
    new push in repo
	at scheduled time
	upon completion of another build
